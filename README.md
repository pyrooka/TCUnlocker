## Usage
- Run the downloaded or builded exe with admin rights.
- To stop, you need to kill it from the task manager.
## Notes
- If you want autostart the app just copy the exe (or the shortcut) to the ```C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup``` folder.
- A service would be better (I've written one), but unfortunately they cannot interact with the desktop.
